# Step 1 Exercises

## Exercise 1: Modify the Board
Try changing the starting position:
1. Move a white pawn from e2 to e4
2. Move the black knight from g8 to f6
3. Run the program to see your changes

## Exercise 2: Create a Custom Position
Create a board with only:
- White king on e1
- Black king on e8
- White queen on d1
- Black queen on d8

## Exercise 3: Understanding Coordinates
Look at the displayed board and answer:
1. What piece is at square a1?
2. What piece is at square h8?
3. Which array indices correspond to square e4?
4. Which square corresponds to array position [3][3]?

## Exercise 4: Add Color to Display
Try to modify the `print_board()` function to:
- Print white pieces in uppercase with some indicator
- Print black pieces in lowercase with some indicator
- Make empty squares more visible

## Exercise 5: Board Analysis
Write a function that counts:
1. How many white pieces are on the board
2. How many black pieces are on the board
3. How many empty squares there are

Example function signature:
```python
def count_pieces(board):
    white_count = 0
    black_count = 0
    empty_count = 0
    # Your code here
    return white_count, black_count, empty_count
```
