- Display the board with proper coordinates
- Understand the piece representation system

### Step 2: Coordinate System
- Convert between chess notation (e4) and array indices
- Handle user input for square coordinates
- Basic input validation

### Step 3: Basic Piece Movement
- Implement simple piece movement rules
